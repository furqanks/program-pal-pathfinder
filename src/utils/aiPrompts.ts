Yo! ðŸ‘‹ I need you to analyze this note in a super casual, Gen Z way. Keep it real and helpful!

**Current Note:**
Title: ${note.title}
Content: ${note.content}
Context: ${note.context_type}
${relatedProgram ? `Program: ${relatedProgram.programName} at ${relatedProgram.university}` : ''}

**Previous Notes Context:**
${contextNotes.map(n => `- ${n.title}: ${n.content.substring(0, 100)}...`).join('\n')}

**What I need from you:**
1. **Vibe Check** - What's the overall mood/energy of this note? (anxious, excited, confused, etc.)
2. **Key Insights** - Break down the main points but make it digestible 
3. **Next Steps** - Give me 2-3 SPECIFIC actionable things I can do right now
4. **Categories** - Tag this with relevant categories (academic, financial, application, research, personal, etc.)
5. **Priority Level** - Rate urgency 1-10 (1 = chill, 10 = DROP EVERYTHING NOW)
6. **Connections** - How does this relate to my other notes/goals?

Keep it conversational but helpful - like advice from a smart friend who actually gets it! Use emojis where it makes sense but don't go overboard.

Hey! ðŸ“… I need you to create a timeline of events and milestones based on all these notes and programs. Make it practical and motivating!

**Programs:**
${programs.map(p => `${p.programName} at ${p.university} - Deadline: ${p.applicationDeadline}`).join('\n')}

**Create a timeline that includes:**
1. **Past Events** - What's already happened based on the notes
2. **Current Phase** - Where they are right now in their journey
3. **Upcoming Milestones** - Key dates and deadlines coming up
4. **Suggested Actions** - What they should focus on each month

Make it encouraging and realistic. Use casual language but keep it organized.

    // Updated prompt to better handle budget-friendly searches and remove asterisks
    const prompt = `Hey there! üëã I'm here to help you find amazing university programs that match your search criteria.

You're looking for: "${query}"

I'll structure my findings in a way that's easy to read and actionable. Think of me as your university research buddy who knows all the best programs!

IMPORTANT: I must provide AT LEAST 8-10 different program options from different universities. If I can't find enough exact matches, I'll include closely related programs to give you more options.

CRITICAL FOR BUDGET SEARCHES: If the search mentions "budget-friendly", "affordable", "cheap", or "low cost", I must prioritize:
- Public universities with lower fees
- Programs under ¬£20,000 per year for international students
- Universities known for value-for-money education
- Programs with good scholarship opportunities
- Avoid expensive private institutions and elite universities unless they offer exceptional financial aid

Format everything in clean markdown with sections, tables, and bullet points. DO NOT use asterisks for bold text - use proper markdown formatting instead.

Organize into these sections:

# üéì Featured Programs

For each program, provide:

Program Name: [Full Program Title]
University: [University Name]
